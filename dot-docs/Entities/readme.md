This Hello World show the first three primary entities (Graph, Node & Edge):  

    graph G {
         Hello--World
    }    

"graph G" represents the graph entity. "Hello" and "World" are two nodes. "--" is a non-directed edge between both nodes.
  
Because of the the spatial meaning of a cluster becomes this the fourth primary entity, although its technical a special characteristic of a subgraph.
