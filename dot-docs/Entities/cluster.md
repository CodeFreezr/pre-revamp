Cluster is a special characteristic of a subgraph, which leads to a spatial grouping. It is described with "Subgraph Cluster[_Postfix] {...}". Without the "Cluster"-Prefix it is just a non-spatial grouping, see subgraph.  
Cluster can have labels, style and can contain nodes, edges or other subgraphs.
