This is the main landing page for the core dot language documentation.  

If you are new:  

1. Take the Graf Vizart Tour (tbd) for e.g. see [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
1. Learning at least the primary entities (Graph, Node, Edge & Cluster)  
1. Step into the attributes for what you need  
1. Examine (attribute-)types for precise value settings  
1. Discover also the secondary entities and the more sophistcated attributes.

At least enjoy the great amount of samples everywhere. A graph paints a thousand words.
